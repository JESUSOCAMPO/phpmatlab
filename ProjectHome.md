PHP extension for reading and writing MATLAB's .mat format.

This is still TOTALLY UNSTABLE (as of 03/31/09) so don't even bother yet.  I haven't even tried building the project yet.  Just using Google Code for source control to keep from accidentally deleting everything.  Should be compiled and tested soon.
